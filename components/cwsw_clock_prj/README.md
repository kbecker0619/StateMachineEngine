# CWSW Clock Services

This project provides standardized clock services for projects that utilize the CWSW components.

This board relies on the selected Board (which in turn depends on a specific MCU architecture) for
regular timing tics.

As of the time of this writing, my intention is to make this design agnostic of the board on which
it runs. It remains to be seen whether I can actually do it that way or not.

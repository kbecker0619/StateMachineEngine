====== Architecture Setup ======
Created Thursday 21 December 2017

Using MPLAB in a "sister" throw-away project to create the skeleton, then COPYING (not linking) the files and/or file contents as appropriate.

created shortcut to harmony's framework (tree is manually pruned to show important-for-now stuff). reference folder is itself a symlink to the actual installation folder. don't know if it's wise or not, but for now i'm ignoring the version of harmony, which as of this writing is 2.04.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"

Microchip target:
Debug_Win_MZ2048EFM : Development and debugging on Windows, using Microchip XC Build Tools
new env-vars:
	''PIC32_XC_HOME=G:\_Programs\Microchip\xc32\v1.44\pic32mx\bin''
		on 2nd test installation: E:\_Programs\Microchip\xc32\v1.44\pic32mx
	''PIC32_XC_INCLUDE=G:\_Programs\Microchip\xc32\v1.44\pic32mx\include''

Cross prefix: (nil)
Cross path:	''${PIC32_XC_HOME}''
Include path:	${''PIC32_XC_INCLUDE}''

to refresh, for MinGW, the two main env-vars:
	''MINGW_HOME=C:\MinGW''		(or wherever you installed MinGW)
	''MSYS_HOME=C:\MinGW\msys\1.0''	(again, verify this is the correct location)

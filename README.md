# State Machine Engine

My own personal design for a generic, event-driven state machine. Includes supporting general-purpose libraries.

As implemented here, this State Machine Engine is not inherently designed to handle heirarchical state machines, although I think it would be an easy extension (and I will add this after the basic design is solid).

====== Workspace Setup ======
Created Wednesday 13 December 2017

===== GIT =====
[[+GIT Setup|git setup]]

===== SVN =====
svn setup

===== CYGWIN =====
[[+Cygwin Setup|cygwin setup]]
env-var:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
HOME=%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%

CYGWIN=winsymlinks:native
}}}

symlinks: http://bit.ly/2ABHFo0

===== GIT BASH =====
git bash setup
env-var:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
MSYS=winsymlinks:native
}}}


===== Eclipse =====
Neon / s32ds / 

To all configurations, add command-line define ''XPRJ_${ConfigName}''


===== MPLab / NetBeans =====
NB 8.1, even when 8.2 was available
MPLAB X 4.05, w/ Harmony v2.04 + the current version of the free XC gcc compiler

Out of the box, MPLAB (not NB) defines command-line define of ''XPRJ_<config>''
MPLAB's Harmony has a requirement that the Harmony install must reside on the same drive letter as your project, which to me makes little sense, and didn't match my install. so, i created a symlink on my projects drive that pointed to my actual installation.

===== Visual Studio =====
VS2008, simply because I want [[LabWindows]] compatibility.

Because this isn't my main dev environment, and because this is a very old version of VS, I didn't spend a lot of time searching the predefined macros to discover the one that tells you the current configuration. I just added the XPRJ_xxx macro to the project configuration dialog.

1. 1st problem, errors out on ''#include <stdint.h>''
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/126279/c99-stdint-h-header-and-ms-visual-studio â‡’ https://github.com/mattn/gntp-send/blob/master/include/msinttypes/stdint.h
copied to my install folder, which was ''E:\_Programs\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include'' 

2. next problem: no <stdbool.h>
that same location didn't have a version of <stdbool.h>. found some other version somewhere

3. because the C compiler for VS2008 is definitely not up to C11 standards, had to change a few of the macros that i normally use. (e.g., dprintf)




===== LabWindows/CVI =====
v7.1 (very, very old - 11 years @ this writing in Dec 2017)

Environment really only understands Debug and Release modes, isn't easy (at least I haven't found it to be so) to add new or change names of those two build targets. To compensate, in my project configuration header (''projcfg.h''), I manually add XPRJ  defines.

1. 1st problem, no'' <stdint.h>''
copied from my VS2008 install (E:\_Programs\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include), to my LW71 install (E:\_Programs\National Instruments\CVI71\include)
2. no <wchar.h>					: ditto
3. next problem: no <stdbool.h>	: remediation: ditto
4. the stdint.h file i copied over, had checks specifically for MSVC. remediation: edit the heck out of it. it is MOST DEFINITELY not compliant!! this removed the "need" for wchar.h

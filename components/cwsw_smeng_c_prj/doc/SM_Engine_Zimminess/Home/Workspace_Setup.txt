===== Eclipse =====
Neon / s32ds / 

===== MPLab / NetBeans =====
NB 8.01, even when 8.2 was available

===== Visual Studio =====
VS2008, simply because ...

1st problem, errors out on ''#include <stdint.h>''
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/126279/c99-stdint-h-header-and-ms-visual-studio â‡’ https://github.com/mattn/gntp-send/blob/master/include/msinttypes/stdint.h
copied to my install folder, which was ''E:\_Programs\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include'' 

2. next problem: no <stdbool.h>
that same location didn't have a version of <stdbool.h>. found some other version somewhere

3. because the C compiler for VS2008 is definitely not up to C11 standards, had to change a few of the macros that i normally use. (e.g., dprintf)




===== LabWindows/CVI =====
v7.1 (very, very old - 11 years @ this writing in Dec 2017)
